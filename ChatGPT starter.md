Excellent — you already have a clear, structured concept here. Your **Discord bot** idea spans multiple systems (onboarding, events, volunteering, announcements, and verification), so the key is to start in **phases**, beginning with the foundation that everything else will depend on.

Here’s a roadmap for where to start and how to build it efficiently:

---

### **1\. Core Setup**

**Goal:** Get a stable, scalable bot running that can later be expanded.

* **Framework:** Use **discord.js v14** (as you noted).

* **Environment:** Node.js 20+ (LTS version recommended).

* **Hosting:** Oracle Cloud is a good choice — configure it to auto-restart your bot on crash (`pm2` or a systemd service).

* **Repository:** Initialize a **GitHub repo** to version your bot and allow collaboration.

**Initial Steps:**

1. Create a Discord application in [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

2. Add a bot user and set required intents (`GUILD_MEMBERS`, `MESSAGE_CONTENT`, `GUILD_PRESENCES`).

3. Set up a `.env` file for tokens and API keys.

4. Implement simple command handling (`/ping`, `/help`).

### **2\. Data Layer / Backend Structure**

This is your biggest differentiator — everything (hours, events, verification, DMs) relies on structured data.

Start with one of these:

* **Option A (simpler)**: Use **Google Sheets** \+ **Google Apps Script API** for lightweight data persistence.

* **Option B (scalable)**: Use a **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** database to store:

  * Volunteers

  * Events

  * Departments

  * Verification logs

For early prototyping, Google Sheets is fine since you already use it for NT’s backend.

---

### **3\. Build Modular Commands**

Each feature you mentioned fits naturally into a command module. Recommended order of implementation:

#### **✅ Phase 1 — Foundation Commands**

* `/verifyuser`  
   → Integrate with Google Sheets API (you already have a sheet system for this).  
   → Assign roles and log data.

* `/contact`  
   → Fetch EC contact info from Sheets or static config file.

#### **✅ Phase 2 — Events & Hours Backend**

* `/events`  
   → Pull from Google Calendar API or Sheets “Events” tab.

* `/hours`  
   → Read from a volunteer hours log.  
   → Include optional parameter for event count (`/hours @user 10`).

* `/requesthours`  
   → Log a request into a Sheet or send a DM to the hours team.

#### **✅ Phase 3 — Automation & DM System**

* Scheduled reminders:

  * Upcoming programs (48h notice)

  * Missing hour reminders

  * News/announcement DMs

* Opt-in/out preferences (store in DB or config file).

#### **✅ Phase 4 — API & Cross-Integration**

* Link with your **Google Apps Script API** endpoints (for emails, logs, etc.).

* Connect to **Google Calendar API** to dynamically list or remind about events.

### **4\. Technical Architecture**

Organize your bot repo like this:

```
src/
 ├─ commands/
 │   ├─ general/
 │   │   ├─ help.js
 │   │   └─ verifyuser.js
 │   ├─ events/
 │   │   ├─ events.js
 │   │   └─ requesthours.js
 │   └─ admin/
 │       └─ contact.js
 ├─ utils/
 │   ├─ sheets.js       // Google Sheets integration
 │   ├─ calendar.js     // Calendar API helper
 │   └─ reminders.js
 ├─ index.js            // Main entry point
 └─ config.json
```

---

### **5\. Next Step Recommendations**

If you want to start building right away:

1. **Set up the Discord.js skeleton** with a slash-command handler.

2. **Google Sheets** backend

3. Implement **one core command** (`/verifyuser`) to confirm the end-to-end flow between Discord ↔ Google Sheets.

4. Once it works, add `/events` and `/hours` with mock data.

---

Would you like me to create a **starter template (Node.js \+ discord.js)** for you, including:

* Working `/verifyuser` command structure

* Google Sheets integration stub

* File structure ready for expansion

That would give you a concrete foundation you can build on.

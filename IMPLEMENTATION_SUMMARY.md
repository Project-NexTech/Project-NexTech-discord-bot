4. Download credentials as `credentials.json`
5. Create spreadsheets for:
   - **Private Volunteer Sheet** (VOLUNTEERS_SHEET_ID):
     - "Limited Data" tab: Name, Email 1, Email 2, (skip D), Discord User ID
     - Contains sensitive data (emails, Discord IDs)

## üé® Architecture

### Modular Design

- Commands organized by category (hours, events, general, admin)
- Reusable utility functions
- Centralized Sheets manager
- Event-driven architecture

### Google Sheets Structure

The bot expects specific column structures in each sheet. Adjust the column indices in `utils/sheets.js` if your sheets have different structures.

### Permission System

- Role-based access control for `/verifyuser` and `/verify`
- Dual-role verification system (NT Unverified & Combined Unverified)
- Cooldown system prevents spam
- Ephemeral messages for errors

### User Experience

- Rich embeds with colors and icons
- Interactive modal forms for verification
- Automatic onboarding welcome messages
- Button-based navigation for external forms
- Automatic department detection from roles
- Helpful error messages

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. Run `npm install` to install new dependencies
2. Set up Google Cloud project and service account
3. Create and configure all Google Sheets
4. Create Google Form for hours requests and get the URL
5. Configure Discord onboarding to assign NT Unverified or Combined Unverified roles
6. Get role IDs and channel IDs from Discord (enable Developer Mode)
7. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in all values
8. Copy `credentials.example.json` data with your service account credentials to `credentials.json`
9. Enable `GUILD_MEMBERS` intent in Discord Developer Portal
10. Deploy commands with `node deploy-commands.js`
11. Test the bot (especially onboarding flow and `/verify` command)

### Future Enhancements (from your spec)

- Automated DM reminders for events
- Email functionality via Google Apps Script
- Google Calendar API integration (currently just shows link)
- Reaction tracking for #nt-news
- Form submission notifications to specific users
- Event signup system
- ‚úÖ Automated onboarding workflows (implemented via `/verify` and role detection)

## üìù Notes

### Customization Points

- **Department names**: Update choices in `/events` and `/contact` commands
- **Role names**: Update in `utils/helpers.js` `getUserDepartments()`
- **Unverified role IDs**: Configure NT_UNVERIFIED_ROLE_ID and COMBINED_UNVERIFIED_ROLE_ID in `.env`
- **Verification team role**: Set VERIFICATION_TEAM_ROLE_ID in `.env`
- **Welcome ping message**: Customize in `events/guildMemberUpdate.js`
- **Verification form fields**: Adjust in `commands/general/verify.js`
- **Admin verification welcome DM**: Customize in `commands/admin/verifyuser.js`
- **Sheet structure**: Adjust column indices in `utils/sheets.js` if needed

### Security

- Never commit `.env`, `config.json`, or `credentials.json`
- Use environment variables in production
- Service account should have minimal permissions (only Sheets access)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Commands not appearing?**

- Run `node deploy-commands.js`
- Check bot permissions
- Verify `GUILDS` intent is enabled

**Google Sheets errors?**

- Verify service account has access to all sheets
- Check spreadsheet IDs in `.env`
- Ensure `credentials.json` exists

**Permission errors on commands?**

- Check user roles match expected role names
- Verify bot has `Manage Roles` permission

**`/verify` command not working?**

- Verify NT_UNVERIFIED_ROLE_ID and COMBINED_UNVERIFIED_ROLE_ID are set correctly
- Check that user has one of these roles
- Ensure VERIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID is valid

**Onboarding pings not appearing?**

- Verify `GUILD_MEMBERS` intent is enabled in Discord Developer Portal
- Check VERIFY_PING_CHANNEL_ID is set correctly
- Ensure Discord onboarding assigns one of the two unverified roles
- Bot must have permission to send messages in the ping channel
